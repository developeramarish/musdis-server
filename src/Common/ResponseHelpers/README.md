# ResponseHelpers

The ResponseHelpers package contains useful response models.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HTTP errors

HTTP errors can easily be converted into [Problem Details response](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807).

Use `ToProblemDetails` method to create Problem Details result for Minimal APIs.

### Predefined errors:

1. `NoContentError` - a no content error, associated with status code 204, cannot be converted into Problem Details. Should only be used as a failure result of some operations (e.g. deletion).

Predefined HTTP errors:

1. `ConflictError` - a conflict with the current state of the target resource, associated with an HTTP status code 409.
2. `ForbiddenError` - an error indicating  that the server understood the request but refuses to authorize it, associated with an HTTP status code 403.
3. `GoneError` - an error indicating that access to the target resource is no longer available, associated with an HTTP status code 410.
4. `InternalServerError` - an error indicating an internal server error, associated with an HTTP status code 500.
5. `NotFoundError` - a resource not found error, associated with an HTTP status code 404.
6. `UnauthorizedError` - an unauthorized error, associated with an HTTP status code 401.
7. `ValidationError` - an error indicating a validation failure, associated with an HTTP status code 400.

### Create custom HTTP errors

If you need an HTTP error which is not available in list above, you can create it by inheriting `HttpError` class.

Override `ToProblemDetails` method if your error need a specific Problem Details response.

## üì® Response models

### `DataResponse<TData>`

The `DataResponse<TData>` class serves as a generic container for encapsulating and delivering data of a specified type.

For single objects:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "some": "data"
    }
}
```

For collection of objects:

```json
{
    "data": [{ "some": "data" }]
}
```

### `PagedDataResponse<TData>`

The `PagedDataResponse<TData>` model is designed specifically for handling paginated responses. It incorporates both the data payload and additional pagination information, making it well-suited for scenarios where data needs to be presented in chunks.

```json
{
    "data": [{ "some": "data" }],
    "paginationInfo": {
        "currentPage": 2,
        "pageSize": 25,
        "totalCount": 100,
        "totalPages": 4,
        "hasPrevious": true,
        "hasNext": true
    }
}
```
